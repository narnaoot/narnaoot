# Hi there!

My name is Nabil Arnaoot and I live in San Francisco.  After twenty years in tech, most recently as a Business Process Engineer at Apple, I'm earning an MS from Saint Mary's College in Business Analytics.  Iâ€™m currently working on a practicum project mapping and analyzing internet access across the US.

I like using data to solve problems and guide strategy, and I'm currently looking for work. Drop me a line if you have any cool projects you'd like to collaborate on!

Fun fact: I'm a passionate reader, and occasional writer, of science fiction.  I like the stuff that explores radically different ways people can live.

## Data Analytics Projects
1.

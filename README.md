# Hi there!

My name is Nabil Arnaoot and I live in San Francisco.  After ten years as a Project Manager, most recently at Apple, I'm earning on an MS from Saint Mary's College in Business Analytics.  I’m currently working on a practicum project mapping and analyzing internet access across the US.

I’m looking for work in the public sector, and I'm particularly excited about using data to improve the lives of marginalized folks.  Drop me a line if you have any cool projects to collaborate on!

Fun fact: I'm a passionate reader, and occasional writer, of science fiction.  I like the stuff that explores radically different ways people can live.
